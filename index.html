          <h2>Jiro is going to space...</h2>
          <div class="block">
            <p>Once upon a time, there was a person named <strong data-style="blue">Jiro</strong> who had always felt out of place on planet Earth. He had always been fascinated by space and the infinite possibilities it held. Jiro often found herself gazing up at the stars, daydreaming about what it would be like to explore the universe.</p>
          </div>
  
          <p>One day, Jiro decided that he had had enough of life on <strong data-style="red">Earth</strong>. He was tired of the chaos and destruction that humanity had wrought upon the planet, and He longed for a simpler, more peaceful existence. So, he set her sights on the stars and began to plan her journey to outer space.</p>
          <p>Jiro spent years researching and preparing for her mission. He read books, watched documentaries, and consulted with experts to ensure that He would be able to survive in the harsh environment of <strong data-style="blue">🌌space</strong>. Finally, the day arrived when he would embark on her journey.</p>
  
          <div class="block">
            <div>
              <p>As Jiro climbed aboard her <strong data-style="red">spacecraft</strong>, he felt a sense of excitement and anticipation that he had never experienced before. He was finally going to explore the unknown reaches of the universe, free from the constraints of Earth and the problems that plagued it.</p>
              <p>For months, Jiro journeyed through space, marveling at the beauty and wonder of the cosmos. He visited distant planets, studied strange phenomena, and made contact with <strong data-style="blue">👽alien</strong> life forms. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
  
          <p>But as time passed, he began to feel a sense of loneliness creeping in. He realized that he had left behind everything He had ever known and loved, and that he may never be able to return to Earth. At first, Jiro tried to push these feelings aside, focusing instead on her work and her adventures in space. But eventually, the loneliness became too much to bear. He longed for the familiar sights and sounds of her <strong data-style="red">🌅home planet</strong>, and he realized that he had made a mistake by leaving.</p>
          <p>Despite her regrets, Jiro continued her journey through space, hoping that someday He would find a way to return to Earth. But as the years passed, he grew old and tired, and he knew that her time was running out. In her final moments, as he gazed out at the endless expanse of stars and galaxies, Jiro whispered a prayer for her beloved planet, hoping that one day <strong data-style="green">🤹‍♂️humanity</strong> would find a way to heal the damage it had done and create a brighter future for generations to come.</p>
